    ,"tRevenue": "<p>The main advantage of Business Intelligence is that your employees will become more valuable assets to the company. Wasting less time on getting all crucial data together from different sources and worrying about the risk of making a mistake along the process, they will spend more time analyzing the information from top to bottom and communicating the result to their managers.</p><p>Integrated data model and intuitive easy-to-use interface requiring no special skills will drastically ease research of complex interconnections inside your business, revealing ineffective or missing processes, causes of potential bottlenecks, hidden risks and opportunities of your company. Your employees will solve business issues instead of technical issues, becoming profound experts of your business domain. And your management will obtain a constant supply chain of valuable insights via clear and meaningful business reports.</p>"
    ,"tPlanning": "<p>Most companies measure their Key Performance Indicators, but most of them stop right there. While these metrics are important, they are often measured at the end of the year or quarter and are reactive in nature.</p><p>Opposed to this Business Intelligence tools allow you to monitor your state of affairs in real-time, gathering data from different sources and providing a high-resolution view of each individual business process via various intuitive visual components. Tracking changes on the flight will allow your company to dynamically respond to the changing environment.</p><p>At the same time, thanks to built-in relations of your data model, getting new measures and indexes via intuitive drag-n-drop interface will not require any specialized skills or additional technical support. Once BI infrastructure is there, the time between recognition of “we need to measure X” and getting the result may be reduced to several clicks. This will boost your business capability to discover ongoing trends in your business area by the first signs.</p>"
    ,"tConsolidation": "<p>Efficient communication is a crucial point to any company’s long-term survival. Whether you are exchanging information with your colleagues from neighboring departments or answering to a board and investors about your startup needs and potential, BI tools will allow you to create a quick dashboard report, highlighting your key points through various visuals.</p><p>Cross platform solution will enable access to all information 24/7 from any device, including your mobile phone. Sophisticated performance enhancement techniques underneath BI instruments will ensure you responsive interactive interface despite enormous amounts of data presented in your reports. At the same time centralized data storage will ease implementing uniform security policy.</p><p>Conflicting stakeholder expectations as well as poor communication are often root causes of many problems occurring in a project. Expressive and easy-to-made BI reports may become the common ground for mutual understanding, accelerating exchange of meaningful ideas.</p>"
